        The project is a complete travel itinerary platform with front-end and back-end components. Its primary goal is to simulate a system for scheduling and managing trips, offering features such as activity tracking and participant management. This project was developed during the NLW Journey, a Rocketseat event, as a way to enhance knowledge of web development using Node.js and TypeScript.

## üìÅ Setup and Run the Application

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before starting, you need to have the following tools installed on your machine: [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

It‚Äôs also recommended to use a code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### üöÄ How to Run the Application

#### Front-End Setup

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ArturColen/plann.er.git

# Navigate to the client folder
$ cd client

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev

# The front-end will start on port 5173 - access <http://localhost:5173>
```

#### Back-End Setup

```bash
# Open a new terminal and navigate to the server folder
$ cd server

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Copy the contents of the .env.example file to a new .env file
$ cp .env.example .env

# Create the database file
$ npx prisma db push

# Run the server in development mode
$ npm run dev

# The server will start on port 3333 - it should log `Server is running on port 3333`
```
